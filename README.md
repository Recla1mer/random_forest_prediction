# random_forest_prediction

Here is the code (and its results) I created in the curse of my bachelor thesis.
I used random forest regression to examine what drives high - $T_c$ values among the SuperCon
database and predicted the $T_c$ for about 30 million chemical compositions.

Please be warned: 

I did not have a lot of programming experience when I started this little project. 
Of course my skills improved greatly as I was coding 24/7 (metaphorically speaking) which made
me realise that I did not write clean, nice code. Especially at the end. You know how it is,
submission date is coming closer and closer which is why you hysterically start to write code 
that works but you leave it as dirty as it is. 

Of course I could decide to go over everything, edit (and add) the documentation and clean my code
but... Well, I really do not want to do that. I mean come on, who is going to end up here
anyway? It is "only" a bachelor thesis after all. 
On my next project I will be more tidy from the start, I promise.
